        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            <img class="image" src="assets/images/spongebob.jpeg" alt="This is me">
            I am 19 years old and currently work at an IT company called Apptio as an intern. I still live with my parents and we have 3 dogs; Bailey, Bella and Sadie. I debated for a while whether I wanted to get a computer science degree or go to a bootcamp. The reason I ended up going to a bootcamp is they teach more relevant skills and don't for me to take irrelevant classes like english and politics. It was also a much cheaper option in the long term so, that sweetened the deal.
            <br><br>
            My junior year of highschool was when I first got into coding with visual basic. I used that for a around a year making very basic windows applications.
            <br><br>
            Through this bootcamp I hope to learn the necessary skills to become a full stack developer adn eventually get a job once I have completed the course.
